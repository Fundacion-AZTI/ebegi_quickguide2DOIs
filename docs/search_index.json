The DOI® system was initiated by the International DOI Foundation (IDF) in 1998 (later standardised as ISO 26324) and provides an infrastructure for persistent unique identification of objects of any type, such as data. It also provides an interoperable exchange of managed information on digital networks (that is to use, or work with, existing identifier and metadata schemes). A DOI name is assigned to data (or any other object) primarily for sharing with an interested user community or managing as intellectual property. DOI names may also be expressed as URLs (URIs). "],["why-and-how-to-assign-a-doi.html", "Chapter 3 Why and how to assign a doi", " Chapter 3 Why and how to assign a doi WHY? It is recommended to provide a DOI name expressed as URL to your dataset or publication and add it to their metadata in order to make them more findable and to track the original authors and science behind. This will provide proper credits to the authors and a confident tracking record. The DOI system offers a unique set of functionalities: • Persistence, if material is moved, rearranged, or bookmarked. • Interoperability with other data from other sources. • Extensibility by adding new features and services through management of groups of DOI names. • Single management of data for multiple output formats (platform independence). • Class management of applications and services. • Dynamic updating of metadata, applications, and services. HOW? The DOI system is implemented through a federation of Registration Agencies (RAs) that use policies and tools developed through the IDF, which safeguards (owns or licenses on behalf of registrants) all intellectual property rights relating to the DOI system. Many millions of DOI names have been assigned to date, through a growing federation of RA world-wide. DataCite is one of these RAs that provides DOIs specifically for research data. Although other RAs also assign DOI-s to datasets, DataCite is the most used for the DOI generation for datasets. DataCite’s global community includes data centres, libraries, government agencies, research universities, etc. Membership is open to all organizations that share the data sharing mission of DataCite. The organization should have its data in repositories to become a membership and consume the DOI service at DataCite. Other way to provide a DOI to your datasets, without becoming a member of a RA, is publishing them in established generic or community specific repositories like Zenodo, Pangaea, SEANOE or others. As mentioned before, at https://www.re3data.org/ you can find a useful and comprehensive registry to find and assess the most suitable repositories for your specific needs and communities. Examples of repositories where the user can assign a DOI without being member of any RA is shown in Table 3. Table 3. Examples of data repositories that generate DOI. To be created "],["fair-principles.html", "Chapter 4 FAIR principles", " Chapter 4 FAIR principles There is a need to extract the maximum benefit from our research investments/outputs and a good data management is essential to achieve this need (e.g., Roche et al., 2015). However, what constitutes ‘good data management’ has been largely undefined and it was generally left as a decision of the data owner. Therefore, bringing some clarity around the goals of good data management and defining simple guidelines to inform those who publish and/or preserve scientific data, is of great utility. For this purpose, Wilkinson et al (2016) described four foundational principles: Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reusability (also known as FAIR principles); that serve to guide data producers and publishers, helping to maximize the added value gained by contemporary digital publishing and, also, adhere to the expectations and requirements of the funding agencies. The FAIR principles apply not only to ‘data’ but also to the algorithms, processing tools, and workflows that led to those data. All digital research objects benefit from the application of these principles, since all components of the research process should be clearly available in the datasets’ metadata to ensure transparency, reproducibility, and reusability (Wilkinson et al, 2016). Findable: Each dataset should be identified by a unique persistent identifier and described by rich, standardized metadata that clearly include the persistent identifier. The metadata record should be indexed in a catalogue and carried with the data. Accessible: The dataset and its metadata record should be retrievable by using the persistent identifier and a standardized communications protocol. In turn, that protocol should allow for authentication and authorization, where necessary. All metadata records should remain accessible even when the datasets they describe are not easily accessible. It should not be confused with Open Data, since FAIR’s Accesible principle grants the data owner the degree to which data is available, or advertised (metadata) (Mons et al., 2017). Interoperable: Both metadata and datasets use formal, accessible, shared, and broadly applicable vocabularies and/or ontologies to describe themselves. They should also use vocabularies that follow FAIR principles and provide qualified references to other relevant metadata and data. Importantly, the data and metadata should be machine accessible and parsable. Reusable: To meet this principle, data must already be findable, accessible, and interoperable. Additionally, the data and metadata should be sufficiently richly described that it can be readily integrated with other data sources. Published data objects should contain enough information on their provenance to enable them to be properly cited and should meet domain-relevant community standards.
