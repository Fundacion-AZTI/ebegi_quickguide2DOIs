# Assign a doi to a dataset

Would you like to assign a DOI to your dataset? You are in the right place.
AZTI recommends you publish your our datasets in public data repositories that will automatically assign a doi to your datasets.
Here you have some recommendations to assign a DOI to your AZTI dataset:

1.	Prepare a summary of your dataset details, including at least, but open to other and more detailed information:

a.	Summary of the dataset, including standardized variable names
b.	Geographical area
c.	Date and frequency
d.	Quality Control (QC) applied to the dataset
e.	Contact
f.	Any other relevant information related to your dataset

2.	Find the most suitable repository for your specific need and communities https://www.re3data.org/ 
3.	Connect to the repository website and follow the instructions to upload your data

4.	Contact Lohitzune Solabarrieta (lsolabarrieta@azti.es) and/or Andrea del Campo (adelcampo@azti.es) if you have any questions.
